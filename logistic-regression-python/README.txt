Logistic Regression Implementations in Python using NumPy and Pandas
@author Saad Moro

This repository contains two implementations of logistic regression written from scratch in Python using the NumPy and Pandas libraries. Running part1.py performs logistic regression using L2/Ridge regularization and tests the efficacy of the algorithm on the data provided. Running part2.py performs logistic regression using L1/LASSO regularization and tests the efficacy of the algorithm on the data provided. Both create plots using matplotlib. The remaining files are the data used by the python files.
